The web app is hosted on Render and can be accessed using https://programmer-recruiter-krish.onrender.com/.

# About the Project
This repository contains the code for a Programmer Recruiter Web App. The web app is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React.js, and Socket.io. The app allows recruiters and freelancers to hire programmers from anywhere in the world by looking at their profiles, projects, experience, certification, and more.

The web app provides recruiters with the ability to filter and search for programmers based on their location and technology stack. They can also filter and search for projects based on keyword search and technology stack. The app also provides real-time notifications features to users on who has seen their profile and projects.
